# Effectiveness-Of-Three-Scalar-Optimization-Methods-
The objective was to test the effectiveness of three different optimization methods used to estimate local minimizers between the brackets of three unique functions. The three optimization methods investigated were quadratic approximation given a single point, fixed stepsize search, and backtracking line search. The effectiveness was determined by comparing the estimated minimizers to the actual minimizers, along with how many iterations it took for each method. The most effective method would be the method which got an estimated value close to the minimizer in the least amount of iterations. The resulting MATLAB code output ran without error or warning and was confirmed to be correct by Emma Ritcey. The results showed that one step of quadratic approximation was the most inaccurate when comparing the estimate and the actual minimizer of each function. As well when comparing fixed stepsize search to backtracking line search both achieved identical estimations equal to each function's actual minimizer. Backtracking line search though was able to complete the estimations in less iterations. Backtracking line search proved to be the most accurate and most efficient of the three methods evaluated.
